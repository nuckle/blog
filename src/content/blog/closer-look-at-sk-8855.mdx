## First Look

Recently, I got my hands on a Lenovo SK-8855 keyboard with a Spanish layout. Its condition is pretty good overall.

<Image src={overview} alt="Overview of Lenovo SK-8855" />

This particular keyboard revision is **R00**. I recall that these keyboards suffer from a controller bug that capitalizes the first two letters when typing very fast (100+ WPM). I didn‚Äôt notice it myself - maybe I‚Äôm just a slow typer! üòÅ

To be honest, it feels like Lenovo tried to cut costs by making the bottom part more minimalistic. Compared to the SK-8845, it lacks additional cable routing options (only the center is available), and the legs have just one position. It‚Äôs fine, but it feels like a downgrade from the previous model.

## Disassembly

To disassemble this keyboard, you need to remove eight screws in total - six visible ones and two hidden under stickers. Then, carefully detach the two halves of the case. I recommend using a plastic card for this. It was easier to start from the bottom to handle the mounting points.

The upper case has no screws; the keyboard simply sits in place.

This PCB serves as the USB controller that makes this keyboard unique. Without it, it would just be a standard ThinkPad keyboard - similar to the SK-8845, which isn‚Äôt compatible with laptop keyboards like this one.

The keyboard itself is nearly identical to the one found in the x20 series ThinkPads. There are small differences, such as the absence of a power button, but overall, they are interchangeable.

The connector here is a standard 40-pin one. It provides a safe way to connect your keyboard to the PCB (or a motherboard in the case of a laptop) without damaging the connector, as the actual keyboard pinout is located on the other side.

## Switches

It looks like this keyboard uses NMB switches. I‚Äôm not an expert, so take this with a grain of salt.

Regardless, they feel nice to type on.

## TrackPoint

The TrackPoint cap was missing, so I replaced it with one from my collection. Out of the box, the experience feels worse compared to a laptop. The cursor is less responsive, slower, and has worse acceleration. I tested multiple cap types, but the result remained the same.

Overall, without tweaking, it‚Äôs not very usable. It‚Äôs cool that it works on any system I‚Äôve tried, but the experience is just not great.

## Software

### Linux

On Linux, everything works out of the box since the keyboard uses kernel drivers. Proper scrolling, middle mouse functionality - zero issues. However, I still find it slow by default on systems I‚Äôve tried.

To fix this, I tried different `xinput` commands to adjust cursor settings, but they also affected my mouse settings and lacked Wayland support. The ultimate solution was to create a [udev rule](https://gist.github.com/nuckle/21d8c6d2c00f6319018ebeb81f3fa9da). It has fewer options compared to `libinput`, but enough to make the cursor faster.

I also wrote [a small script](https://github.com/nuckle/dotfiles/blob/main/.local/bin/thinkpadledd) to fix LED indicators for the speaker mute state. Yes, they don‚Äôt work out of the box - it seems like they were intended to function only under Windows with specific drivers.

### Windows

On Windows, the TrackPoint and scrolling experience is worse compared to Linux, but still usable.

I used [TPmiddle](https://github.com/Jyny/TPmiddle), and while it wasn‚Äôt perfect, it got the job done.

However, there seems to be a better alternative called [TrackPointDriver](https://github.com/Slion/TrackPointDriver). I‚Äôd recommend trying this one instead.

## Personal Experience

I really like this keyboard, but I feel it‚Äôs a bit overhyped. I didn‚Äôt pay $300 for it, nor did I actively search for months. I got it cheaply and mostly by accident. Under these conditions, I like it - but otherwise, it‚Äôs just too expensive. Maybe it‚Äôs a good item for a collection, but there are far better options available if you‚Äôre willing to spend that much money.

Also, the construction doesn‚Äôt feel very strong. After all, it‚Äôs just two pieces of plastic held together by eight screws. It‚Äôs quite thin. I‚Äôd recommend checking out [this ThinkWiki article on mitigating this issue](https://thinkwiki.de/USB_Keyboard_Mod). That said, I do like the fact that it‚Äôs lightweight - it‚Äôs not as heavy as you might expect.
